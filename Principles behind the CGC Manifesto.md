# Principles behind the CGC Manifesto



We follow these principles:

- Our highest priority is to *empower* the *females*
through meta-learning of self-learning programming skills  
我们最重要的目标，是通过赋予女性自学编程的元学习能力

- Welcome changing IT technologies. Self-learning harness change for 
the competitive advantage.  
欣然面对IT技术的变革。为了竞争优势，自学掌控变化。

- Deliver working software frequently, from a 
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a 
preference to the shorter timescale.

- Roles(TA/Checker/Recorder/Self-learner) must work 
together daily throughout the course.  
所有角色必须相互合作，课程中的每一天都不例外。

- Design course around motivated individuals. 
Give them the environment and support they need, 
and trust them to get the task done.  
激发个体的斗志，以他们为核心设计课程。提供所需的环境和支援，辅以信任，从而完成任务。


- The most efficient and effective method of 
conveying information to and within a club is face-to-face conversation.  
不论Club内外，传递信息效果最好效率也最高的方式是「面对面的交谈」。

- Learning by teaching is the primary measure of learning progress.  
「可教授她人」是学习效果的首要度量标准。

- CGC promote continueing learing, not based on the continuety of time and spase, by taking advantage of internet tools   
提倡可持续学习。通过利用互联网工具，摆脱必须在同意地点和同一时间的限制。

- Continuous attention to technical excellence 
and good design enhances agility.  
坚持不懈地追求技术卓越和良好设计，敏捷能力由此增强。

- Using public, free and online learning resources -- the art of maximizing the amount of course design work not done--is essential.  
使用公开、免费的互联网学习资料，是极力减少不必要课程设计工作量的艺术。

- The best organization's architectures, requirements, and designs 
emerge from self-organizing clubs.  
最好的组织架构、需求和设计出自自组织团队。

- At regular intervals, the club reflects on how 
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts 
its behavior accordingly.  
团队定期地反思如何能提高成效，并依此调整自身的举止表现。
